search device @loc:Grenoble   ==> returns the list of all managed devices 
search variable @loc:Grenoble  ==> returns the list of all managed sensors 
search variable usage:Temperature or usage:Voltage or usage:Current ==> combined conditions to filter sensors 
search variable (usage:Temperature or usage:Voltage) or (usage:Current and @loc:T3) with value < 50  ==> combined conditions to filter sensors 
search variable @loc:Grenoble with name==temperature or (with unit == A and with value > 15)  ==> filter with loacation, name, unit, value
All the search variable ... queries can be used for aggregation. Example: 
avg variable @loc:Grenoble 
min variable @loc:Grenoble and usage:Temperature with value > 10 
search variable usage:Temperature or usage:Voltage 


To test the Rules Engine, there are some sample lua rule provided within the SRE_examples project.
NB: In V1.0, you need to have the two folders "SRE_Console/lua/CMS"  and "SRE_Console/lua/scripts"  before testing the rules engine, if not create them manually. 
NB2: execute "repo sync" to get the latest changes 

Examples of Rules Engine commands: 
install SRE_Console/lua/mock_rules/AirConditionner.nonsigned    ==> installs the AirConditionner rule 
install SRE_Console/lua/mock_rules/Heater.nonsigned ==> installs the Heater rule 
state                                       ==> shows the list of installed rules
